# TrackMouse
Display the coordinates of the mouse on the screen.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running the python file make sure you have the following...

```
1. python3
```
```
2. pyautogui
```
```
3. tkinter
```

The file can be edited for python2

### Run Command

```
python3 trackmouse.pyw
```

Note: The file extension is '.pyw' so that the app runs without showing terminal/konsole

## What I Learned

* Use of tkinter in an Object Oriented Design (Include updating label text)
* Delaying an invokation of a method using the after method
* Receiving x, y coordinates of a mouse using pyautogui
